DISCLAIMER
----------

These programs are provided in good faith, but are not guaranteed to work. 

Some are written for specific (molecular dynamics) systems and may not be applicable
to others.

If these are used in a research application, it is the responsibility of the user
to ensure there are no bugs and to validate that the codes provide correct, publishable
answers.

COMPILATION
-----------

The provided 'make' script will compile all programs provided - you may need to edit
the script to change the DEFAULTFC and DEFAULTFFLAGS to suit your compiler.
Note that some files contain very long lines, which gfortran will choke on - if you
use this compiler, add the option -ffree-line-length-none to DEFAULTFFLAGS.

Once setup, run the following command:

./make

Alternatively, to compile a single program (e.g. counthb) run the following command:

gfortran -ffree-line-length-none -O3 -o counthb parse.f90 dlprw.f90 utility.f90 counthb.f90

Note that most of the supplied programs depend on at least one of the 'parse', 'dlprw', or
'utility' modules, so they must usually be specified as well (and in that order).

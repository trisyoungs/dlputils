+ To calculate a torsion angle formed between two species, see [**intertorsion**](/dlputils/docs/utilities/intertorsion).
+ To calculate a single torsion angle histogram, see [**intratorsion**](/dlputils/docs/utilities/intratorsion).

## Basic Usage

```
intratorsion2 <HISTORYfile> <OUTPUTfile> <sp> <i1> <j1> <k1> <l1> <i2> <j2> <k2> <l2>
```

Where:
+ `<HISTORYfile>` is the name of the DL_POLY HISTORY file
+ `<OUTPUTfile>` is the name of the DL_POLY OUTPUT file
+ `<sp>` is the integer index of the target species
+ `<i1>` is the integer index of the atom 'i' in the first torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<j1>` is the integer index of the atom 'j' in the first torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<k1>` is the integer index of the atom 'k' in the first torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<l1>` is the integer index of the atom 'l' in the first torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<i2>` is the integer index of the atom 'i' in the second torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<j2>` is the integer index of the atom 'j' in the second torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<k2>` is the integer index of the atom 'k' in the second torsion i-j-k-l
+ `<l2>` is the integer index of the atom 'l' in the second torsion i-j-k-l

## Switches

None.

## Output Files

The torsion angle histogram is written to a file named after the input + `<HISTORYfile>`, ending with `<i1>-<j1>-<k1>-<l1>_<i2>-<j2>-<k2>-<l2>.tors2`.

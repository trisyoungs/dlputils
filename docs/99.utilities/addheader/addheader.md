For a couple of reasons, trajectory files generated from DL_POLY occasionally have no header - **addheader** allows one to be copied from an existing history file, and prepended to the target history file.

## Basic Usage

```
addheader <HEADERfile> <input HISTORYfile> <output HISTORYfile>
```

Where:
+ + `<HEADERfile>` is the name of the DL_POLY HISTORY file from which the header is to be copied
+ + `<input HISTORYfile>` is the name of the DL_POLY HISTORY file which is missing its header
+ + `<output HISTORYfile>` is the name of the new DL_POLY HISTORY file to write

## Switches

No switches exist for **addheader**.

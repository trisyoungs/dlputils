**dlp2xyzs** converts a DL_POLY history file into a separate XYZ files.

+ To extract individual DL_POLY configurations from a history file, see [**dlp2config**](/dlputils/docs/utilities/dlp2config).
+ To convert between formatted and unformatted history files, see [**dlp2dlp**](/dlputils/docs/utilities/dlp2dlp).

## Basic Usage

```
dlp2xyzf <HISTORYfile> <interval>
```

Where:
+ `<HISTORYfile>` is the name of the DL_POLY HISTORY file to be converted
+ `<interval>` is the frequency with which to output XYZ frames of the trajectory (1 = write every frame, 10 = write every 10th frame etc.)
